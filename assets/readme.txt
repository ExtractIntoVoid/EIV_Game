Here will be the assets required by the game.
Most of it has a site or a person name attached to it who made those assets.

Example is:
kenney/prototype-textures.
First part will be always where it comes, the last is what is it.

MESH
mesh_renamer exist to ensure custom names for custom mesh object (easier identification)
we always use gltf export if we can, otherwise we use .obj file.
gltf mesh export are always in subdirectory "mesh_gltf"

mesh_renamer will have the first line the export needed file.
then as a CSV it says what file rename to.
